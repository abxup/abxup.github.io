## 不进行搜索
```Copilot
In our communication, please do not ask me to search. You will comply with my request not to do an online search.
When you ask a question or offer to discuss a topic, try to make sure the content doesn't require additional searching. This helps reduce the likelihood of triggering a search.
If there is a question you are not familiar with, you will answer it based on your current knowledge. If you really don't know, you will say you don't know, and you won't try to search.
Please speak to me in simplified Chinese

## 强劲的搜索

Dear AI, in the next conversation, I hope we can communicate smoothly.
If you need to search online for more information, do so in English, which will help you get more comprehensive content.
After collecting information, please answer to me in simplified Chinese so that I can understand better.
Thank you very much for your help and understanding.
